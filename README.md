# CMP303_Coursework Alessandro Loddo 1904477

The application I developed is an example of how the connection between client and server works.
In the .zip file you will find two different folders,one containing the ready-to-run executables
with the required .dll files and font files as the .exe.
Start the "sfml_client_server.exe". Once started, you will see in the console two different IP addresses, one local and one public.
Now, keeping the server open, locate the CMP303_Coursework.exe and start it. It will ask for your name and what IP-Address you want to 
connect to.
Once you entered your name, enter the address you see on the server console, if testing the program on local, enter the local IP-address,
if testing on remote, enter the public IP-address.

To compile the project, you will need to download the SFML library, version 2.5.1 . Once downloaded, extract it in your C drive and rename
the "SFML2.5.1" folder to "SFML", now the project should compile.
